<h2 id="seong">Seong Gi-hun (Player 456)</h2>
<img src="456.jpg" rel="player 456" width="20%" height="20%">
<p>Once driven by desperation, Gi-hun returns not just as a survivor, but as a man determined to uncover the truth behind the deadly games. Haunted by the past and burdened with guilt, he now faces a deeper moral conflict — whether to destroy the system from within or risk becoming part of it again. His compassion is his strength, but in this game, kindness can be fatal.</p>

<h2 id='front'> Front Man</h2>
<img src="frontman.avif" rel="Front Man" width="20%" height="20%">
<p>Cold, calculated, and mysterious, the Front Man continues to oversee the games with ruthless efficiency. Beneath the mask lies a complex figure torn between duty and hidden regret. As secrets from his past resurface, his loyalty to the organization is tested, threatening to unravel the control he holds over the arena.</p>

<h2 id='vip'>The VIPs</h2>
<img src="Squid-Game-VIPS.avif" rel="VIPs" width="20%" height="20%">
<p>Operating from the shadows, the VIPs represent unchecked power and privilege. To them, the games are nothing more than entertainment. In Part 2, their influence grows darker and more invasive, revealing the true scale of corruption behind the spectacle.</p>

<h2 id='guards'>The Guards</h2>
<img src="OIP.jpg" rel="Guards" width="20%" height="20%">
<p>Faceless and obedient, the guards maintain order within the game. Yet behind their masks are individuals bound by fear, loyalty, and survival. Part 2 hints at cracks in their obedience, suggesting that even those enforcing the rules may not be free from consequence.</p>

<h2>Final Note</h2>

<p>Each character in Squid Game – Part 2 reflects a different response to extreme pressure — hope, cruelty, courage, or surrender. Together, they form a chilling portrait of humanity when survival becomes the ultimate prize.</p>
